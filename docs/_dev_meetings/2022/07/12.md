## AWS Issues

Michael has seen a variety of error messages coming from AWS, especially an insufficient data response, indicating that the inbox might be full. This led to an investigation into the AWS messaging and queuing services, upon which several other problems were found.

**First Problem:** Michael has received word that the AWS org account needs to be migrated to a new organization. This email was sent on Friday, and a meeting will be scheduled tomorrow for clarification. If the organization does have to be migrated, Marek notes this could cause downtime on Commons.

**Second Problem:** As mentioned previously, AWS SMS has been sending an insufficient data response. Edwin mentioned that if the email account receiving the notification didn't exist, a hard bounce would be created. However, Marek pointed out that if these email issues persist, Commons may be blacklisted for sending spam emails.

**Third Problem:** Ahmad has been creating test users with fake test emails. When the confirmation email for a playbook change is sent, this causes spam emails to go to fake users, all of which create soft bounces in the queue. Pierce changing his email address also seems to have caused several bounced emails, which could be causing all the problems.

## Next Steps

**AWS:** Michael has fixed the situation as much as possible so the alarms are cleared. He will also look at the feasibility of disabling emails in beta and dev.

**Dev:** Today's deployment is at 4pm. Marek will take care of the server, Edwin the front end, and Terri the API. Changelogs will be updated accordingly.
