## Testing

Ahmad's testing has found the below errors before Friday's deployment:

**First Error:** when a new package is created, as a user in the Global Campaign Strategy Unit, the title cannot be saved and displays a "title is invalid" error message. This issue is described in [CDP-3017](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3017). There is a concern that this issue wasn't caught during unit testing.

**Second Error:** when a video file is uploaded to Vimeo, if a supporting SRT file is not uploaded at the same time, the upload will cause a "file loading" error. This error has not been found in production, and exists only in beta and dev. However, the error appears to be coming from the server, as the video support file query is not working. None of this code has been edited since the migration to Prisma. This issue is described in [CDP-3016](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3016).

## Deployment

**Next Steps:** the recommendation is to move the release, including user management, to next week. There does not appear to be enough time to do testing and create a hotfix to remediate these issues.
