## AWS Issues

**Description:** According to Marek and Michael, in the last meeting with the AWS team they suggested that triggers should be able to be disabled. The AWS team was provided with the ARN and error file. Once these triggers are disabled (from the root account), the RDS restore should run. Marek and Michael will try this out in GPA LAB 2.

### Okta

**Description:** Marek reached out and discovered it is necessary to have a Classnet account to fill out the form. Cheryl may have a Classnet account, so all requests will have to go through her.

### Commons

**Description:** Going forward, tickets may be added to the backlog because there is no bandwidth on the team to continue resolving tickets before the transition to Aprimo. Detailed descriptions will need to be logged, as tickets may not be reviewed for some time. Temi noted there is an issue when uploading a video in Press Guidance, as found in ticket [CDP-3020](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3020). This issue occurs when a video is uploaded, then deleted, then another file is added.
