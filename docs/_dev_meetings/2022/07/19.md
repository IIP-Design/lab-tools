## Everyone Is Leaving

**Description:** Edwin, Terri, and Ahmad are all transitioning off the Commons project in the next few weeks, necessitating the knowledge exchange of several processes and the changing in ownership of any documents of which they are the owner. Terri noted that it is inconvenient that there is no feedback process or exit interview process for contractors leaving State.

## Next Steps

**Edwin:** Document troubleshooting issues and go through the email and queue issues in AWS. Do the walk-through before Thursday.

**Terri:** Work on the Prisma 3 related issues that might have been missed, and document the restore process properly.

**Ahmad:** Ensure tickets are completed and move any new tickets to the backlog.

## Coming Up

The Aprimo demo will take place on Thursday.
