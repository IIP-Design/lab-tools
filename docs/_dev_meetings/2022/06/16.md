## Troubleshooting

**Commons Issues:** Previously, there was an issue where type names needed to be added to all returning queries. Currently, in Apollo, the page count is null and the images are empty. However, in dev it appears to be working. The documents are available in S3, so the issue isn't there.

**Problems in Production:** According to Julie, another issues has come up when you try to fill in the title field while uploading press guidance. As a user is typing in the title, intermittently things on the page may start to rearrange. This points to an issue that may be present in the beta database? 

As the development environment has additional fields for user management that main doesn't, if migrations are merged in, changes will have to go all the way up to production. Also, the management pages are restricted to admins only on the server.
