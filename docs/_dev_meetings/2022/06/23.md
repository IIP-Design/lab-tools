## Testing Issues

**Description:** The null character issue is causing the thumbnail issue noted in beta. Uploading a different PDF works. Since the API version has been rolled back, clearing cache may help fix the issue. Currently, there are hotfixes in both dev and main waiting for release, as well as the User Management story.


**Next Steps:** The hotfix on dev will be merged into main for deployment and testing in beta. Tomorrow, the User Management story can be merged to beta. Also, the API and client fixes can be deployed tomorrow. For future reference, Kubernetes needs to be updated in production (beta is running a different version) which can wait until Temi comes back and will cause about a day's worth of downtime.
