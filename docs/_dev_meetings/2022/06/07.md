## Commons Hotfixes

### Testing Environment

Temi and Ahmad asked for some clarification as to where hotfixes should be tested. A simple heuristic is that hotfixes are always tested in beta, while everything else should be be tested in dev. While this is a good rule of thumb, the devs should still always specify which environment the fix has been deployed to when passing a ticket on to QA. The QA environment (alternately called the gpalab.digital environment) is still running, but will be terminated upon merging in the Prisma 3 changes.

### Playbook Landing Page

The team has identified an issue with the playbook landing pages in production, wherein the pages simply show a loading screen and nothing ever appears. On closer inspection, we found that the wrong query was being executed looking for a category rather than a policy priority and thereby returning no hits. The Human Rights playbook list is "working" only insofar as Human Rights appears as both a policy priority and a category and the page is loading in playbooks tagged with the category `human rights`.

The reason this is happens is that the page template that renders these landing pages (`playbooks/[taxonomy]/index.js`) utilizes the `__typename` property on the GraphQL response to determine whether a given term is a category or a policy priority. With the migration to Prisma 3, the `__typename` property no longer exists in the GraphQL response and hence this check is broken.

```js
// Starting on line 58 of playbooks/[taxonomy]/index.js, the code identifies the
// taxonomy typename and renders the appropriate version of the PlaybookArchive component

if (policyData && categoryData) {
  // determine which archive to display based on __typename present in data structure
  const [type] = findAllValuesForKey({ ...policyData, ...categoryData }, '__typename');

  let query;

  switch (type) {
    case 'Category': {
      query = () =>
        getItemsByCategoryRequest({
          type: 'playbook',
          category: title?.replace('and', '&'),
        });

      return renderPlaybookArchive(query, title, 'Messaging Effort', '#112e51');
    }

    case 'PolicyPriority': {
      const policy = policyData?.policyPriorities[0];

      query = () =>
        getItemsByPolicyRequest({
          type: 'playbook',
          policy: policy.name,
        });

      return renderPlaybookArchive(query, policy.name, 'Policy Priority', policy.theme);
    }

    // assume no allowed typename was returned, display playbook with no policy
    default:
      return <PlaybookLoader id={taxonomy} redirect={redirect} />;
  }
}
```

### Removing Broken Infocentral Link

Edwin reported that he ran into some issues with when testing the [client PR #422](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/pull/422), which removes the press guidance archive link on the per [CDP-2992](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2992). The portion of the code that removes the link seems to work just fine. However, the additional changes introduced by Marek refactoring that section to CSS modules is broken on Edwin's local.

There seems to be some issues with the cascade so the `display: flex` property on the packages list is not being applied correctly. Rather everything renders all scrunched together at the beginning of the section as seen below.

![A screenshot of the "Latest Guidance Packages" section rendering improperly in such a way that all four of the packages are rendered stacked one on top of the other rather than evenly spaced out.]({{ '/assets/2022/06/packages-css-issues.png' | relative_url }})

Marek said that he experienced something similar to this early on, but that he corrected it during the course of the refactor. For the sake of expediency, Marek will cherry-pick the commit removing the Infocentral link into a separate branch which will be submitted as a hotfix. The conversion of the packages section to CSS modules can wait for another day and will be re-submitted as a separate pull request.

### Open Questions

In the course of the discussion two smaller issues were also raised (without resolution):

1. We need to clarify some of the interactions between teams and users therein. What happens when a user is removed from a team (for example to the user's access level and organizational affiliations)? If a team is deactivated, do we preserve the team's links to it's users or are they all removed from the team? What about the inverse when a user is deactivated, would they still remain on their old team? What happens if a user moves from one team to another?
1. Terri mused that when a logged user visits the login page, the are welcomed with an empty screen. This is a odd and potentially confusing behavior. Instead, They should be redirected to the home page.

### Retrospective

Marek expressed concern about how the issues with subscription emails and the playbooks landing pages made it through testing and into production. The problem was fundamental to the server changes, so there is no way that tests of the email pipeline could have passed if they were tested.

Several culprits were identified that, if addressed, can help reduce the likelihood of such problems in the future:

- Temi and Ahmad are solidifying their test cases, including those for emails and policy priority pages. Having these docs to guide their regression testing should help maintain a consistent standard.
- Our pull requests are too large are infrequent to allow for meaningful code review. The developers should endeavor to push their changes more frequently and in smaller chunks, so their counterparts doing the code review can get a better grasp of the changes.
- The team moved too fast to get this release out and did not complete sufficient regression testing. Unfortunately, this problem is of largely external origin and unlikely to change. Terri suggested that a shift to three week sprints may help, but Marek feels that there is little appetite from leadership to accommodate this change.
- There is some reticence among the team in testing the playbook notification feature. This hesitance comes from a desire to avoid spamming real users with test emails. This discomfort is somewhat unavoidable and we should exercise caution in testing these features, but they cannot be ignored and testing in dev/beta should always be safe.
- Some of the missed Playbook issues may have stemmed from confusion about which environment features should be tested in. The [above discussion](#testing-environment) should address some of that confusion.

### Next Steps

Each of the developers will create tickets for the portions of this conversation relevant to the what they are working on:

- [CDP-3000](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3000) - Playbook email notifications (Terri)
- [CDP-3001](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3001) - Playbook landing pages (Terri)
- [CDP-2992](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2992) - Remove Infocentral link (Marek)

We can possibly engage Anna in writing the acceptance criteria to improve the clarity of that task to be tested. The team will put together a deployment checklist for the hotfix deployment in our [Thursday (June 9) meeting]({{ '/dev_meetings/2022/06/09.html#deployment-checklist' | relative_url }}).

## Cloudflare Terms of Service

Marek shared with the team that he received an email from Cloudflare regarding their [updated Data Processing Addendum](https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/) (DPA) which add a new EU [Standard Contractual Clauses ](ttps://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-scc/). In short it appears that Cloudflare is updating their terms of service to better comply with GDPR and EU privacy laws. The email states that our DPA needs to be updated by December 27, 2022 and if we take no action before July 1 the new provided terms will be activated.

Marek asked if anyone on the team was familiar with the terms of service we were previously under and if so, what the process for getting those approved was. Nobody seemed to know whether there is any action required on our part to check/approve the terms of service before they go into effect.
