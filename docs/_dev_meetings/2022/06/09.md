## Deployment Checklist

The team identified two issues pertaining to playbooks that necessitated a hotfix release.

1. Playbook creation/update notification emails are not going out ([CDP-3000](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3000))
1. Most of the policy priority landing pages are not loading in any playbooks ([CDP-3001](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3001)). Terri found that a difference in the case sensitivity of SQL vs PostgreSQL queries are causing some of the issues. Terri will put in a [PR](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/pull/430) to resolve the issue as well as acceptance criteria for testing the fix into the Jira ticket. Marek will review the PR after which Temi will test in the beta environment.

In addition to these patches related to the Prisma 3 migration, the team also identified two broken links on the site homepage. Specifically, press guidance archive site and Infocentral have been (or are in the process of being) decommissioned. Ticket [CDP-2992](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2992) was created to simply remove these links and the changes are also being included in this release.

## Environmental Variables

**Description:** What is displayed on the website is out of date. There is no comprehensive list of the current, correct environmental variables.

### Client

The client `.env` template hasn't been updated since January 25, 2019. As such all the entries are out of date. They still use the older `REACT_APP_` prefix that has since been replaced with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Additionally, most of environmental variables aren't listed at all. The variables listed in the README are more up to date than the template file, but should still be reviewed.

### Server

The server `.env` template hasn't been updated since September 30, 2019. As such it missing most of the environment variables that are currently in use (particularly those pertaining to AWS, Elasticsearch, or RabbitMQ). The values listed in the README are more accurate, but still list some obsolete entries related to Cloudflare.

### API

The API is missing a `.env` template entirely. This file should be creating adding the entries listed below. Like the client and the server, environmental variables listed in the README are closer to accurate but should be updated as well.
