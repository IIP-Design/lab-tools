## Null Characters in Parsed Text

**Description:** Edwin gave the team a brief readout of his work in resolving [CDP-3005](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3005). He found that the problem does not lie with the the generation of the thumbnail image, which completes successfully. Rather the issue originates with the content node on parsed PDF file. This issue throws an error, which blocks the API worker from completing the PDF file processing (hence the thumbnail does not appear in the client even though it is present in S3).

The cause of the error is the presence of an invalid character - `0x00` - in the parsed HTML of certain PDF files. This character is the [hexadecimal null value](https://newbedev.com/hexadecimal-value-0x00-is-a-invalid-character) and apparently PostgreSQL does not like it. Michael found a question on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1347646/postgres-error-on-insert-error-invalid-byte-sequence-for-encoding-utf8-0x0) that indicated the best way to resolve this is by running a RegEx to remove the null bytes before sending over to PostgreSQL.

The resultant RegEx may look something like this (note this is conjecture, please validate):

```js
const re = /\x00/g;

// Update 06/22/22 - below is the correct test

const re = /\0/g;
```
