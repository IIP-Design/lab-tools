## Testing Issues

**Description:** There is an intermittent issue when a user is saved, the changes don't persist. Issue cannot always be replicated.

The next issue is that not all of the required field - those denoted with a red star - are actually required to create a new user. This creates a difference between those fields required to create a user on the front end, and those field that are required according to the schema.

Lastly, there is an issue in the display of the total number of search results and how many are being displayed on the page. If the number is "x out of y with z total results", when viewing the last set of results, y and z should be the same number, but they are not. This is likely because y is showing the total number of pages multiplied by the view number, which will not always reflect the true number of results.


**Next Steps:** For all of the above issues, tickets need to be created. The intermittent saving issue will need to be fixed before deployment. The Bureau/Mission and Office/Post options should be made optional. And a ticket needs to be created for the display count issue, but it will be put in the backlog.
