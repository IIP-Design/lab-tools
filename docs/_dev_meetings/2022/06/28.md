## Testing Team/User Management

**Description:** Ahmad identified several issues while testing the new team and user management interface on the Commons beta environment.

1. The primary issue reported was intermittent issues with the autosave functionality when editing a user. Ahmad ran into issues when editing a user's name, leaving the page, and then returning to the user edit screen. The autosave growl notification displays, but the changes do not persist. The issue cannot be consistently replicated. - _Ticket [CDP-3010](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-3010) was created to address this issue and assigned to Edwin._

1. Second, Ahmad noted a discrepancy between the required user fields on the create user modal and the edit user screen. These differences can be seen in the following table:

   | Field                 | Create User Modal | Edit User Screen      |
   | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
   | First Name            | Required          | Required              |
   | Last Name             | Required          | Required              |
   | Email                 | Required          | Required              |
   | Organization          | Required          | Required              |
   | **Bureau or Mission** | **Not Present**   | **Required**          |
   | **Office or Post**    | **Not Present**   | **Required**          |
   | Job Title             | Not Present       | Optional              |
   | Country               | Not Present       | Optional              |
   | City                  | Not Present       | Optional              |
   | Access/Role           | Required          | Required (w/ default) |
   | Team                  | Optional          | Optional              |

   As highlighted in bold, the Bureau/Mission and Office/Post are really the only two differences that may be problematic/confusing. Further muddling the case is that most of these "required" fields are only required in the sense that the form validation demands them. They are not, however, required by the user type in the schema. After some discussion, the team concurred that the best resolution is to simply remove the required indicator (red asterisk) from the the Bureau/Mission and Office/Post fields on the edit user screen. This should limit confusion and maintain closer adherence to the schema. One caveat is that we may want to set the team field to be required in both places as any user we edit/add manually will be added with the intention of uploading content (and hence must be a member of a team).

1. Lastly, the range element of the search pagination is not displaying the correct number for the end of the range. If the range is "results x through y out of a total z results", then y should never exceed y. As can be seen in the screenshot from beta below, the range indicates that the page is showing results 7921 through 8010, even though there are only 7930 possible results.

   ![Large heading with the text "Users", followed with a range indicator displaying 7291 through 8010 of 7930 results.]({{ 'assets/2022/06/user-range-indicator.png' | relative_url }})

   This impossibility only appears on the final result page and results from the slightly naive way in which the range end is calculated. Namely, it adds the selected starting point and the pagination interval, even if that sum exceeds the total number of results. As such the range end will always show an incorrect number on the last page unless the total number of results is a multiple of the pagination interval.

   ```js
   // Line 6 of ManagementDashboardViewControl component
   // Where take is the pagination interval and skip is the starting point
   const rangeEnd = allItemsCount < take ? allItemsCount : take + skip;

   /** Possible refactor **/

   // Check if there are fewer items than the pagination interval
   // or more than the pagination interval plus the starting point
   const outOfRange = allItemsCount < take || allItemsCount < take + skip;

   // If one of the two conditions above is met, show the total number of items
   const rangeEnd = outOfRange ? allItemsCount : take + skip;
   ```

**Next Steps:** Tickets need to be created and assigned for all of the above issues. The intermittent saving issue and removing the required flag on the Bureau/Mission and Office/Post fields should be completed ahead of the user management feature release. The range count issue is less concerning and can be added to the backlog.

## Infrastructure

**Description:** Marek and Michael briefly discussed some issues that require the team's attention.

### AWS

First Marek raised the email received today (June 28) from DLT, our AWS reseller. They indicating that we need to migrate to a new AWS organization. This is the second such email (first received on June 15.) and it states that:

> DLT maintains many AWS organizations and regularly applies updates to ensure security and governance at the organization level. Your current organization has had a service life of almost ten years, and to remain in compliance with AWS best practices, it has become necessary to migrate all accounts to a new organization.
>
> Migrating your account will not result in any disruption of service, and all your account infrastructure and services will migrate with your account to the new organization. As the root account holder, action is required on your part to facilitate this migration.

It sounds like this should be a straight forward update. However, one complication may be that Mark is still email on the root account. We may need to switch that over to someone on the team before we can proceed with the migration.

### Cloudflare

We also received two more in a series of emails from Cloudflare about the need to re-approve certain domains for certificate renewal. Specifically, this time the two domains are:

1. www.api.america.gov
1. www.api-stage.america.gov

These domains seem to get flagged and dropped out of automatic renewal when they do not receive traffic. This is not surprising as we do not utilize the www subdomains. The only reason that we have them at all is that Blue Team scans of our domains always look for this subdomain and give us grief if it does not exist/have a certificate.

## Commons Client Dependencies

Edwin shared the a [list of outstanding dependency updates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLbm0GMweLBGRHKfU5v7bndULYcd5yqybqz068NrzMc/edit) on the Commons client. He broke out the list by severity and likelihood that they will be disruptive.

We should now look at the list to determine which updates are acceptable to complete at a level of effort commensurate to being in "maintenance mode".
