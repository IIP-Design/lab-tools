The meeting began with an introduction of Ahmad, who has joined the team as a quality assurance tester, Following introductions, the team shared a number of Slack channels that they felt Ahmad should join including:

- #content-commons
- #commons-graphics
- #commons-video
- #design-devs
- #digital-lab
- #lab-devops
- #lab-product-contentcommons
- #lab-projects

They also gave Ahmad an overview of the team's development cycle namely, two week sprints often with design running a week ahead and QA running a week behind development.

## Implementing ESLint Updates

On Wednesday (March 23) as part of the upgrades to the server dependencies ([CDP-2870](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2870)) Terri ran into issues with ESLint. Specifically, she upgraded to the latest ESLint configuration ([v1.6.0](https://github.com/IIP-Design/eslint-config/releases/tag/v1.6.0)), which resulted in auto-formatting no longer working in VSCode. Even after updating

Finally, after some further digging, she realized that the server repo was still using a the old, deprecated [babel-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-eslint) parser. Once she installed the newer [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser) and updated the `parser` setting in the `.eslintrc` file, linting began to work as expected.

## Bucket Takeover Vulnerability

Marek gave the team a brief run down of the bucket takeover vulnerability reported by the IRM's Cybersecurity Integrity Center. The problem stemmed from a DNS configuration of america.gov subdomains meant for static asset S3 buckets. These subdomains were previously used by the ShareAmerica, State Magazine, and Translations WordPress sites. Michael and Marek responded to the vulnerability report and were able to immediately resolve the issue.

This incident is more thoroughly documented in the [readout]({{ '/dev_meetings/2022/03/23#bucket-takeover-vulnerability' | relative_url }}) from yesterday's ad hoc meeting and in the full [security incident report]({{ '/postmortems/2022/03/23' | relative_url }}).

## Apollo Sandbox

The rest of the meeting was used by Terri to describe the new GraphQL IDEs provided by the Apollo GraphQL tool suite - [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio) and [Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/sandbox). Apollo Studio is "a cloud platform that helps you build, validate, and secure your organization's graph." Apollo Sandbox is a version of Apollo Studio intended fot local development and includes:

- The Explorer - an in-browser "IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations"
- Schema reference

Apollo Sandbox is enabled by default in development. When running, it creates GraphQL server on localhost that makes the data available to be read by Apollo Studio in the browser. Michael had some concerns about making data available to a third party site this way. While there is little concern about running this for our local sites, the team may need to be cautious when running with backups of production data.

Another requirement is that the URL `https://studio.apollographql.com` is enable in CORs for the sever app so that the local server can connect to Apollo Studio. Marek wondered if if would be possible to conditionally enable this based on the current environment (ie. only enable in development).

These concerns would be alleviated by a self-hosted version of Apollo Studio, however, that does not seem to be an option, even for paying users. As it stands now, we would not even be able to use Apollo Sandbox on our development and beta sites, since those are both run in production mode.

These tools are meant as a replacement for the [GraphQL playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/), which was [deprecated](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/#graphql-playground) in move from Apollo version 2 to 3. Although deprecated, the playground is still available and can be reenabled by using the GraphQL playground plugin as such:

```js
import {
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground,
  ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled,
} from 'apollo-server-core';

new ApolloServer({
  plugins: [
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled()
      : ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});
```
