## Flaky Tests

**Description:** The Commons client repo has a number of tests that are flaky, meaning the result of the test is inconsistent across different runs.

Observed behavior:

- Certain tests pass/fail inconsistently
- Some tests pass in the CI test runner but fail when run locally (or vice versa)
- They seem to be async tests, and increasing the wait time sometimes resolves the issue (temporarily)

The below table looks at a selection of recent [reports](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml) from the Commons client repo's test runner workflow. It identifies which components reported failing tests for each of the selected test runs.

**Failed Tests In Detail:**

As seen from the error report below, nearly all the flaky tests have to do with verifying the presence of an error message when the component is in an error state.

The failing `PlaybookPreview` test:

```js
it('renders an error message if there is a GraphQL error', async () => {
  const ErrorComponent = (
    <MockedProvider mocks={errorMocks} addTypename={false}>
      <PlaybookPreview {...undefinedItemProps} />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
  const wrapper = mount(ErrorComponent);

  await wait(0);
  wrapper.update();
  const container = wrapper.find('PlaybookPreview');
  const error = errorMocks[0].result.errors[0];

  expect(container.contains(error.message)).toEqual(true);
});
```

Edwin believes that these errors began when we recently updated the Apollo client package. It appears that there is some spillover across tests as altering the timing on one tends to introduce errors in different tests. We should verify that all the tests are actually isolated and that we are not missing any necessary cleanup. Perhaps we should consider suppressing these particularly flaky tests for now to reduce the noise from the test runner.

## Organizing Util Functions

**Description:** Terri initiated a conversation about how we organize our utility functions in the client repo. Currently we have one util file that is long and difficult to read through. We have a lot of duplicated functionality as we re-write functions for which equivalents already exist in the codebase.

The team generally agreed that the utils are a bit of a mess. They should be grouped by they (such as string manipulation or date/time functions) and placed in a file with a descriptive name. All of these files should reside at the root of the `lib` directory. If this gets unwieldy, we can further group them into subdirectories.

There are also a number of of functions that in component or component controller files that should be extracted to be made available to the whole codebase.

Terri also suggested using doc comments for the functions, which in conjunction with the [JSDoc package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) can be used to automatically generate function definitions and documentation.

Edwin suggested that eventually we could even extract some of these utilities as a generic library that can be used throughout our various projects.

**Next Steps:** During the course of their work, the devs should consolidate and re-order the utils as they see fit using the guidelines outlined above. Terri will being to implement JSDoc at some point in the near future.
