## Commons Test Cases

Temi presented her work in setting up a standardized process for writing and preserving test cases. She shared a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wwic0cRlXyZjoAPIXn8qah1AFrSENMXXFXRN2wNJQUU) where she is writing out repeatable test cases. Each tab of the spreadsheet indicates a different portion of the application to be tested. Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a particular feature/behavior to be tested.

Every test case contains the following properties:

- Test Case ID - A unique identifier
- Test Objective - What the test is meant to accomplish
- Pre-Condition - How to get to a state where the test can be executed
- Test Case - A one-line description of the test
- Test Steps - Actions to take to execute the test
- Expected Result - What the result of the test should be
- Actual Result - What the result of the test actually is
- Pass/Fail - Whether the test passed or failed (i.e. the result matched the expectation)

Temi is still in the process of gathering test cases, so many of the test cases are still incomplete. She requested help from the rest of the team brainstorming additional test cases to add and filling the gaps in the cases that have been added. Rather than take the whole application at once, she is focusing her efforts on the current work in progress - login flow, email subscriptions, and (soon) reports.

Temi indicated that this spreadsheet is the easiest way to work on the test cases in a consolidated fashion, but that it is possible to export the document and import these test cases into Jira for a more integrated development-QA process.

Edwin suggested that once she has finalized the spreadsheet, Temi save it as a template file. That way rather than copying an editing previous version with each release she can just create a new one from the template.

Temi also shared a document that outlines her [testing approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTSr7_XtldsgqkqdYbrc8cq7ts5B0NheeE7E044pVe0/) and requested feedback from the rest of the team. This document provides a high level overview of the types of testing to be done, the parts of the application included in testing, and the tools used during testing.

**Next Steps:** Temi will continue to flesh out the test cases for login and playbook subscriptions since those are fresh in her mind. After that, she will start to add test cases for the Research and Analytics reports as requirements and mockups are solidified. The team will have to go back and add test cases for the existing features that have been added to date.

## YALI Indexing Issues

**Description:** Marek discovered that non-thumbnail images for YALI articles indexed into Commons are all broken.

![Screenshot of a YALI article in the Commons search result modal. The thumbnail image appears correctly, however the first image is the body shows a missing image icon.]({{ '/assets/2021/11/yali-broken-image.png' | relative_url }})

It appears that the [YALI site](https://yali.state.gov) has been moved over to the MWP 2.0 platform and this has caused some problems regarding integration with Commons. Namely,

1. No new YALI content has been indexed into Commons since June 23, 2021. We suspect that the new YALI site does not have the feeder plugin installed and hence is no longer indexing posts.
1. Articles that were previously indexed still appear in Commons, but they now have broken images within the body of the article.

In the course of moving the site, the Web team changed the base URL of their static asset files from `https://yali.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/` to `https://uploads.mwp.mprod.getusinfo.com/uploads/`.

There are two possible ways to address this issue:

1. The preferred way is to re-index the posts so that the post content node is updated with the new image URL. This will not be possible if the feeder plugin is missing on the .
1. Run a script against the post data in the API updating the base path to the asset. This approach assumes that all the posts are still present and that all the image URLs have changed.

The articles' thumbnail images still appear properly because they are copied over during the course of indexing and stored as part of the Commons data.

## Deployment Checklist

**Deployment Window:** November 19, 2021 (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

**Personnel:** Terri, Michael, Edwin, Temi, Marek

**Content Freeze:** No content freeze needed

**Order of Operation:**

1. Merge v5.10.1 hotfix back into develop
1. Update the changelog for the client
1. Tag the client release as minor version -> v5.11.0
1. Take snapshots for backup (Prisma DB and Elasticsearch)
1. Run client code build via Jenkins
1. Re-enable notifications on develop (i.e. override the v5.10.1 merge to allow for testing)

## Email Notifications Troubleshooting

Michael and Edwin are continuing to see issues with the playbook email notifications. Even small numbers of emails (1-2 emails) aren't going through. Furthermore, tests that Edwin previously ran successfully are now failing to work consistently.

Edwin opened a ticket with AWS support yesterday (Nov. 17). AWS support responded to Edwin's inquiry but were not particularly helpful.

> After reviewing the metrics from the 15th of November to now for the function ‘gpalab-send-email’ I noticed the following:
>
> - ConcurrentExecutions is 1 most of the time (except a spike on the 17th where invocations were very high). Batch Size on the SQS integration is 1 so this is expected as lambda will pick only one message at a time.
> - The Invocations metrics shows 3-4 messages, but this is also expected. CloudWatch aggregates the metrics to 5 minute intervals and even if you lower the time interval to 1 minute, the metrics aggregates to sum of all messages in that minute so you may not see the 7 reflected in the metrics.
> - I also do not see any errors during that time period

This is all information that we already know and they seem to believe that this issue is with CloudWatch not capturing the metrics rather than the actions falling through before the Lambda invocation.

One theory is that the emails are failing because we are we on a suppression list, however that does not seem to hold water. Some email do go through, we are receiving no errors or bounce alerts, and every recorded invocation of the Lambda function results in a successful send. This would indicate that the issue is the interface between SQS and the Lambda function.

**Next Steps:** Edwin will respond to AWS support today with more details. He'll explain that our concern is not a matter of unreconciled CloudWatch metrics, but rather that the Lambda is not being invoked at all. We know this is the case looking a the Lambda invocation monitoring and due to the fact that users are not receiving the emails.

## Updating Apache HTTP Server

In order to stay compliant with the known vulnerability worksheet sent to the dev team yesterday (Nov. 17) by Farshad, Michael is updating Apache HTTP Server (httpd) across all the servers.

The courses, content, lab, and RFJ sites may be impacted by this change. The only environment that is of real concern is the RFJ due to it's age and sensitivity. In addition to regular backups, Michael will take snapshots of the RFJ instance prior to the update so that if something goes wrong he can quickly revert back to the state as it was.

The RFJ site was to be transitioned out of our environment entirely, but we have heard nothing regarding this for some time. Perhaps we can revive this conversation and completely relinquish control so that we do not have to worry about these updates.
