## Team Updates

Michael and Terri were both out today. The rest of the team had a quick touch base to go over what they have on their plates post-Commons release.

- Cheryl has a Commons training session scheduled for later today. She will be showing members of the Campaign Strategy Unit how to log into Commons and upload playbooks. The training will occur on the beta environment. Cheryl wanted to confirm that she should have the trainees log into beta to make sure that their accounts are enabled.
- Marek has been transferring the Jenkins build pipelines to a shared library stored in AWS CodeCommit. This will allow the team to to more easily reuse pipeline components across multiple projects. He gave a quick overview of the changes he's made and why they are beneficial. He'll put together a more comprehensive presentation when he's completed the work.
- Edwin turned his attention to the data visualization R&D work he started some time ago. With the story telling project upcoming, he wants to be ready to apply what he's learned to the project. The content focus on green jobs may lend itself to some interesting applications of data-visualization techniques.
- Temi is finishing up testing of the Saturday (July 17) Commons release. She has gone through the full list of tickets in the testing column and as yet has discovered no issues.

The meeting was adjourned early.
