Terri, Michael, and Marek met to discuss how the team wants to proceed with efforts improve the isolation of internal Commons content. Rather than storing all published content in a single bucket, and retrieving it using cryptographically signed URLs, we feel it would be simpler and more effective to store internal and public content in two separate storage buckets. This will result in a three-bucket setup:

1. **Authoring** - The current authoring bucket (`amgov-publisher-prod`) will remain as the authoring bucket. This is the "source of truth" for assets. Additions, modifications, and deletions will occur here first and then propagate to the appropriate bucket upon publish (or unpublish as the case may be). The bucket will be fully locked down and accessible only by the application using AWS instance profiles to provide access.
1. **Internal** - The current production bucket (`staticcdp`) will become the internal bucket. This bucket will be used to store sensitive content (such as press guidance files). Access to this bucket will be curtailed so that only authenticated users can retrieve content via the application by means of a signed URL. Assets from this bucket will not be cached and will utilize the `s3.amazonaws` URL.
1. **Public** - The bucket formerly used to store content from the publications site (`static.america.gov`) will become the public bucket. Used for fully public content (such as thumbnails and shareable graphic files), there will be no access limitations. Furthermore, the content will be cached on the CDN to improve performance.

The following environmental variables will need to be edit/added:

| Repo   | New Env Variable                 | Replaces                           |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| api    | AWS_S3_INTERNAL_BUCKET           | AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_BUCKET           |
| api    | AWS_S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET             |                                    |
| client | REACT_APP_AWS_S3_INTERNAL_BUCKET | REACT_APP_AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_BUCKET |
| client | REACT_APP_AWS_S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET   |                                    |
| server | AWS_S3_INTERNAL_BUCKET           | AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_BUCKET           |
| server | AWS_S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET             |                                    |

## Content Type Sub-Directories

In order to improve organization and simplify management, all assets should be placed in subdirectories that match the content type of their parent project. This is currently the case with playbooks, graphics, and daily guidance packages, which are stored in the `playbook`, `social_media`, and `daily_guidance` subdirectories, respectively. However, the files for early content types (post, course, and video) are not separated into subdirectories and are co-mingled in shared year/month directories.

Before proceeding, we will need restructure to bucket to add the missing subdirectories and move the appropriate content therein. For the most part mixed content can be separated by the indexing domain of the project. Namely,

- The indexing domain `courses.america.gov` should go to the course subdirectory;
- The indexing domains `share.america.gov`, `yali.america.gov`, and `ylai.america.gov` should go to the post subdirectory;
- The indexing domain `commons.america.gov` should go to the video subdirectory.

However, there are some exceptions to the above rule of thumb. Video content was initially added using the courses WordPress site, so the early video content uses the courses indexing domain. Additionally, any posts added using the content site will have the `commons.america.gov` indexing domain. These exceptions are relatively rare, but will need to be addressed manually.

The team also felt that the `social_media` directory should be renamed to `graphic` so that it more closely matches the content type it represents. All told, the directory structure at the bucket root will look like so:

| Type      | Current SubDir | New SubDir |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| courses   |                | course     |
| graphics  | social_media   | graphic    |
| packages  | daily_guidance | ?          |
| playbooks | playbook       | playbook   |
| posts     |                | post       |
| videos    |                | video      |

Once the public content is copied from the `staticcdp` to the `static.america.gov` bucket, we will need to cleanup the old bucket, so that only internal content remains.

## Segregating Internal and Public Content

In addition to the separating static assets by content type, we must now also separate it by visibility. Within each project's asset directory, we will add two sub-directories.

- The `p` directory will store publicly accessible content.
- The `i` directory will store internal-only content.

In the authoring bucket, the directory for a given project will have both directories present. However, in the internal bucket a project will only have the `i` directory and in the public bucket a project will only have the `p` directory.

## Full Path

Putting it all together, the file path for a given piece of content will be composed of

1. The content type
1. The uploaded year
1. The uploaded month
1. The project identifier, which itself is made up of:
  - The indexing domain
  - The project id in GraphQL
1. The visibility value
1. The filename

This structure can be represented using the following illustration:

The internal asset path URL playbook/2021/07/commons.america.gov_ckql3t8v014gv0760gev4q7ba/i/internal.docx, is compiled from the content type of playbook, the date 2021/07, the origin site commons.america.gov, the project id ckql3t8v014gv0760gev4q7ba, the visibility i, and the filename internal.docx. Similarly, the public asset path URL playbook/2021/07/commons.america.gov_ckql3t8v014gv0760gev4q7ba/p/public.png is composed from the content type of playbook, the date 2021/07, the origin site commons.america.gov, the project id ckql3t8v014gv0760gev4q7ba, the visibility p, and the filename public.png."

## Publishing Flow

When content is uploaded through the Commons publisher, it will be added to the content type, date, and project id directory to which is belongs. If it is internal content it will be added to the `i` sub-directory otherwise it will be placed in the `p` sub-directory.

On publish, the entire `i` directory will be copied over into the internal bucket (with each file maintaining the same full path). Similarly, the entire `p` directory will be copied over into the public bucket (again maintaining the same file path). Concurrent changes will have to be made to the following actions:

- Update a project
- Unpublishing/deleting a project
- Deleting a file
- Changing the visibility on a file (for example, delete assets from internal bucket, move the copy in the authoring bucket from the `i` to the `p` subdirectory, sync the updated `p` directory to the public bucket)

Changes will also need to be made so that to the Elasticsearch feeder WordPress plugin to route all indexed content to the post subdirectory. If these updates require changes to the feeder itself the Lab team can update plugin update on the Courses and Content sites. However, we will need to coordinate with the Web team to enact them on YALI, YLAI, and ShareAmerica.

Video uploads will have to be updated to go to the `video` subdirectory and graphics uploads to the `graphic` subdirectory rather than `social_media` directory.

## Elasticsearch

Once existing content is moved to subdirectories, we will need to update the URLs in the API to reflect the new filepaths.

- Content type subdirectories will need to be added to course, post, and video content
- The `p`/`i` subdirectories will need to be added to all URLs
- Add a visibility property set to public for the thumbnail objects on videos and posts

This can be done with a series of Painless queries run via Kibana.

## Client Side

Rather than fetching signed URLs for every asset on the frontend, we will need to assess the asset's visibility and pull from the appropriate bucket. In some cases this will be easy. Thumbnail images for posts, for instance will always be public. Document files for press guidance packages will always be internal. The difficulty enters when dealing with mixed content types that may be internal or public.

This change may actually be fairly straight forward in most cases, give that the frontend generally gets the asset URLs off of the API. If we set the URL property correctly in the API the rest should follow on the Commons frontend.

There is some question as to how we should treat content for which visibility cannot be determined. Emphasizing backwards compatibility would assume it is public unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Emphasizing security would make the opposite assumption. We will have to assess the potential impact further before making a final determination.

## CDP Modules

The single article and article feed embed modules pull in the post thumbnails from the API. So long as the thumbnail URL in the API is correct the images should load properly.

Since the public API provides thumbnail URLs as a fully qualified URL, the shouldn't be any changes to these two products. However, we want to be mindful of any breaking changes (ex. using the file path rather than full URL) while moving forward.

We will have to assess how the courses module
