## Commons Release To Do's

**Description:** The meeting was essentially a preparatory session for the this Saturday's (July 17) Commons release. The team recapped our deployment plan, reviewing the [list of tasks]({{ '/dev_meetings/2021/07/13.html#commons-prod-deployment' | relative_url }}) compiled during Tuesday's (July 13) meeting and adding any missing items.

Terri discovered that the background field was inadvertently removed from the packages edit form. This happened when a the package edit form was combined with the playbook edit form into a unified form for all package types. She is working on correcting the issue and believes that she'll be able to utilize the internal description field which is present in the form but unused by playbooks.

_Update (July 15):_ Resolved in commit [c2a0006](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/commit/c2a0006be777299721a1ee7e35198cdd0e03b5fe) on the client repo

Terri pointed out that there is currently no created or updated date associated with Commons users. This make is difficult to identify when users created accounts and thereby compare user numbers over time or track user growth as a result of milestones. She suggested adding such a date to the data model so that we can easily query the number of users added after the playbooks release. Marek strenuously objected to this, stating it was feature creep and too late in the game to add this before the current release. He stated that any changes to the underlying data structure should be made with extreme caution and not rushed. After some discussion, the team agreed that we should hold off on the change for now. We can note the number of users before the release and then extrapolate the number added after the fact.

Edwin discovered a bit of a bug in the text editor component whereby links pasted from Google Docs into the editor are colored black rather than the typical blue link text. Further inspection showed that this was because the link text is wrapped in a `<u>` tag so the `<a>` tag's color property is overwritten by the  editor's CSS. Specifically, this is how the links are rendered:

```html
<p style="margin-left:15px;">
  <a href="https://my-content.com">
    <u>This is the link text</u>
  </a>
</p>
```

The editor styles in `TextEditor.module.scss` set the text of all child elements to black as seen here:

```scss
.editor {
  * {
    color: #000;
  }
}
```

This has the effect of interrupting the cascade and preventing the text from inheriting the link color. The simplest way to resolve the issue to probably to alter the specificity on that CSS selector.

_Update (July 15):_ Addressed in commit [b8f911c](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/commit/b8f911c570684d7920bd130ab9dc67d974af200d) on the client repo

One major item missing from our current release task list is creating the playbook index in Elasticsearch. The team made a note of this oversight and added it to the punch list.

Terri recalled that we need to update the `ui.json` file in the static assets repository to include the playbooks section on the production site. Below is the required snippet:

```json
{
  "key": "playbooks_1",
  "component": "Playbooks",
  "order": 2,
  "props": {
    "postType": "playbook",
    "locale": "en-us",
    "pin": []
  }
}
```

_Update (July 17):_ Added in commit [748193e](https://github.com/IIP-Design/iip-static-assets/commit/748193ee1de27d93829612eb9ff8e23c02f602d0) on the IIP Static Assets repo

Marek suggested that the dev team double checks with the designers that the policy priority names and colors are correct. These are the current values:

- COVID-19 Recovery - #dd7533 ![orange swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dd7533/000000?text=+)
- Alliances and Partnerships - #449dac ![teal swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/449dac/000000?text=+)
- China Relations - #c10230 ![red swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c10230/000000?text=+)
- Climate Crisis - #94bfa2 ![light green swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/94bfa2/000000?text=+)
- Human Rights - #f9c642 ![yellow swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f9c642/000000?text=+)
- Refugees and Migration - #8168b3 ![purple swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8168b3/000000?text=+)

_Update:_ After checking with BreAnn, the Climate Crisis color should be the darker green color: #00833E ![dark green swatch](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00833E/000000?text=+).

The meeting was adjourned early to allow everyone to complete their pre-release tasks.
