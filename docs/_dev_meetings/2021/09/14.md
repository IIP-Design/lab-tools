## Dependency Updates

The devs have each upgraded one of the environments up to the minor versions of each dependency. Below is an assessment of outstanding major version dependencies updates and their potential impact. The following key indicates what each icon in the "Update" column signifies:

|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ | We can safely update now. |
| ❌ | Will break the app or require significant refactoring. Hold off on updating for now. |
| ❓ | Needs further investigation before we can decide. |

The `js-cookie` package is listed at ^2.2.1 and can be updated to 3.0.1. However, it is no longer needed since the recent changes to that [authentication flow]({{ '/dev_meetings/2021/08/10.html#login-flow-refactor' | relative_url }}).

Marek cautioned about updating `node-sass` and `react-markdown`. He attempted both of those upgrades previously and had to revert them.

- `node-sass` - Upgrading this caused massive peer dependency issues with our current extension of the default NextJS/Webpack configs.
- `react-markdown` - Changed all exports to ESM and will require changes to the Next.js configure to function (since ESM is not natively supported in Node.js). Marek attempted to use the [next-transpile-modules](https://github.com/martpie/next-transpile-modules) package to overcome this, but was unable to get it working.

Marek wondered why React wasn't upgraded to version 18. Turns out the React 18 is [still in alpha](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html). We should definitely wait until a stable release before upgrading.

Terri suggested removing the full [lodash library](https://lodash.com/) in favor of installing just the particular package that is needed. Edwin and Marek concurred with this decision.

Incidentally, Terri was wondering why `@next/bundle-analyzer` is listed as a dependency rather than a dev dependency. Marek wasn't sure, but believed that it was to avoid the `node/no-unpublished-import` linting error. If so this is easily resolved by adding `@next/bundle-analyzer` to the `allowModules` array under options for that rule.

## Miscellaneous

1. Michael updated the base images to move from Node 10 to 14. The image for the server is a bit different because he also upgraded [FFMpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (which is used to encode/decode multimedia content).
1. Michael is experimenting with [OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) to restrict access to our dev environments. This might be particularly helpful for the gpalab.digital environment.
1. Temi has a meeting coming up on devising a strategy for formalizing the testing process. This process should improve the way that we currently gather functional specifications, record requirements, develop test cases, and write user stories.
