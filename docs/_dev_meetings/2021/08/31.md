## Code Deprecations

**Description:** We have a lot of old/outdated code present in Commons at the moment. Terri has run into a dilemma whereby she would like to remove old or redundant code but is nervous to in case it results in unintended consequences. She has suggested that we adopt the practice of deprecating code going forward, so that we can remove outdated code in a controlled fashion and limit possible fallout. Obsolete code should be marked as deprecated so that we know to stop building on it and that it is slated for removal.

Unless we are confident that the code is unneeded, we may want to delay deleting deprecated code until a major version release. This way we can avoid potential breaking changes. This consideration is more salient for libraries rather than web application/site source code where we can be more certain that it is safe to delete code.

**Decision:** Going forward we will use the deprecated tag as recommended in the [JSDoc documentation](https://jsdoc.app/tags-deprecated.html). If possible, these doc comments should indicate at what version the code was deprecated and when/under what conditions it will be removed. In practice this would look something like:

```js
/**
 * Legacy function that does something cool.
 * @deprecated Since version 2.0.0. Will be removed in next major release.
 * @see {@link newFunc} The updated way to do something cool.
 */
const oldFunc = () => {
  console.log( "I'm so out of date!" );
}
```

## Commons Email Notifications

**Description:** Edwin provided an update on his research into an email notification solution for Commons. In his testing he continues to see issues with duplicate emails.

He read about another method using AWS [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) to keep track of which emails have already been sent, thereby reducing the likelihood of redundant sends. This approach would require him to include a [Redis client for Node](https://redis.io/clients#nodejs) in the Lambda function. The preferred option seems to be [node-redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis).

Michael is going to help Edwin stand up the required Redis cache so that he can test out this method of de-duping.

When in place, this system will be used for bulk emails and notifications. One-off transactional emails (such as user registration) will continue to be handled by the server.

Edwin also reiterated the need for a dead letter queue to handle send errors. He will investigate this once he has resolved the issue with duplicates.

## Slack Notifications

**Description:** Marek raised concerns about the fact that the webhook reporting GitHub push events to to the [#design-devs](https://pdchat.slack.com/archives/G03HV7Q0E) channel in Slack has stopped working.

On August 18 we amended the events sent via the webhook for the Commons client and server repos. Rather than just reporting push events, we also included pull request data. This worked for a couple hour until the following message showed up in the channel:

![A message from Slackbot stating that it "disabled and integration in this channel: github"]({{ '/assets/2021/08/slack-integration.png' | relative_url }})

Following that that message, all GitHub webhook events ceased. These notification are a critical part of our team's operations and we should endeavor to get it resolved ASAP.

_Update (Sept. 8):_ Marek reached to Alex from R/PPR to enquire about the broken webhook. Alex provided no feedback in the affirmative or the negative about whether the functionality can be restored. Marek will reach back out later in the week.
