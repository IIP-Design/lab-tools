## Commons Quick Hits

Terri reported out on the tasks she is working on:

  - Will be reviewing Marek's API pull request [#102](https://github.com/IIP-Design/cdp-public-api/pull/102)
  - Next she'll review Edwin's client pull request [#332](https://github.com/IIP-Design/content-commons-client/pull/332)
  - Thereafter she'll resume her work on on her tickets adding vanity URLs for playbooks. This work in progress includes:
    - Removing `getInitialProps` from all pages
    - Using only the one token (from Cognito) for authentication

Terri explained to Marek the changes to the Commons priorities that were made while he was out. Namely,

- vanity URLs for playbooks are the main priority to be delivered in the next three weeks
- the next priority is email notifications, which Edwin working on it now. Edwin is out of the office next week, so Marek will pick up this work where Edwin leaves off.

Marek will also start prefixing post [CDP-2509](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2509) and video [CDP-2507](https://design.atlassian.net/browse/CDP-2507) files with the content and visibility directories as [previously discussed]({{ '/dev_meetings/2021/07/23.html#content-type-sub-directories' | relative_url }}). He will move his tickets up from/back to the backlog as appropriate.

The topic of outdated code came up again. Team agreed that we should clean up where confident we can do so without adverse impacts and note things that should be deleted.

## Email Notifications

**Description:** Edwin presented his initial research for implementing an email notification system for Commons. 

The requirements are to allow user the option to opt into individual playbook notifications and/or notifications when a new playbook is added. The first allows users to track updates to a specific playbook. The second one would only notify users on creation for new playbooks, and they will have to subscribe to each playbook individually for additional updates. Users must also be able to unsubscribe from either type of subscription.

Edwin set up a test [Node.js app](https://github.com/IIP-Design/lab-test-server) using [Node mailer SES transport](https://nodemailer.com/transports/ses/) to connect to AWS SES.

Testing tools:

- [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/) to test bulk email sends.
- [AWS mailbox simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-simulator.html) to test various response types (success, bounce, etc.)

SES rate limiting:

- Hard limit of 50 addresses and 14 sends/second required chunking
- There is also a `MaxConnections`, although Edwin is not sure what that is

We still haven't determined what the backend set up should look like. There are a variety of option including:

- Worker-based actions
- A dedicated server 
- Serverless functions

Michael encouraged Edwin to use SQS rather than RabbitMQ for queuing the email batches.

Edwin also explored a couple third party options:

- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) - two separate APIs (one for marketing and another for transactional), their own templating syntax
- [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/) - no official Node implementation
- [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/)

## ClamAV

**Description:** Michael reported that he has now implemented ClamAV virus scanning on Commons production bucket as well the publisher bucket.

Marek asked whether this means that all files added via the publisher are getting scanned twice (once in the publisher bucket and once in the production bucket). Michael explained that this was not the case because files copied from the publisher bucket are already tagged as clean when they are copied.

## Sprint Planning

The team expressed some concern about the state of our sprint planning sessions. They find the hours long meeting draining and feel it is not the most productive use of our time. The principal complaints are that:

- There are too many tickets added to each sprint
- We talk about tickets in too much detail leading to circular conversations

Edwin suggested that we could set a timer to limit how much time we spend discussing each ticket.
