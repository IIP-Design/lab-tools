title: Finite State Machines with XState
date: 2021-02-08
description: State machines are a mathematical representation of system. They are used to describe the behavior of that system at any given moment and generally consist of five parts. 1) a set of possible states, 2) a set of possible events, 3) an initial state, 4) functions that determine the transitions between states, and 5) a final state. XState is a library used to implement state machines and use them to manage state in JavaScript applications.
