Below are the minutes from the bi-weekly meetings of the GPA Lab development team. This meeting - which is attended by developers, system administrators, and quality assurance - seeks to fulfil the following goals:

1. Come to a team consensus on standards and operating procedures pertaining to development, testing, and operations.
1. Identify technical debt, system/code deficiencies, and areas for improvement. Once found, devise a plan to address these weaknesses.
1. Determine priorities and map out strategies to best deploy our limited resources.
1. Explore new technologies and seek out opportunities for interesting and worthwhile work.
1. Share knowledge and learning opportunities with other members of the technical team.
