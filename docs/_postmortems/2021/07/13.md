## Summary

On the afternoon of Tuesday, July 13 the Lab team noticed a number of _400 Bad Request_ errors reported in our Cloudflare dashboard. These failed requests originated from our public API (api.america.gov) with the referrer for most of them being the [YALI Site](yali.state.gov).

In the course of investigating the cause of these errors, the Lab team noticed unusually markup in the server response when loading YALI pages. Specifically, all pages on the YALI site contain the following div element:

```html

</div>
```

This list of links is extremely suspicious, particularly the link text (ex: "Make money"). It includes pages both within and outside of GPA-managed domains, generally linking directly to a PHP file.

The list is rendered far off of the visible page. Given this placement, it appears clear that the links were never intended to be accessed by users but were added to be read by indexing robots (such as Google search) crawling the site. This could be indicative of somebody trying to boost the SEO score of their site by means of malicious [link building](https://www.wordstream.com/link-building). In other word if a site with a high reliability score (i.e. YALI) links to their site it boosts them higher in search algorithms.

Perhaps more concerning than the list itself, however, is that the links to file on GPA-managed sites are valid URLs. We did not test all the links but, for example, _https://yali.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/wikinews.php_ is an actual web page under the YALI domain. Presumably this means that the _wikinews.php_ file exists in the site's upload directory.

**The implication is that whoever added these links and files has access to arbitrarily add/change files on the production site.**

## Impacted Sites

Looking at other sites under GPA management, YLAI contains the same div element (i.e. list of links) on all of it's pages. 

State.gov, MWP, Share America, State Magazine, TechCamp, Translations and all Lab managed sites appear not to contain this or similar snippets.

Based on of the list of links present on YALI and YLAI, there are a number of potentially malicious files uploaded to Department properties. These files are, by domain:

- Share America:
  - wp-content/uploads/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/make-money/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/2021/make-money/wikinews.php

- State Magazine:
  - wp-content/uploads/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/make-money/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/2021/make-money/wikinews.php

- YALI:
  - wp-content/uploads/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/make-money/wikinews.php
  - make-money/wikinews.php

- YLAI:
  - wp-content/uploads/sites/wikinews.php
  - wp-content/uploads/sites/make-money/wikinews.php
  - make-money/wikinews.php

We must note that we are only aware of these files because they were included among the referral links. Presumably, if a malicious actor was able to add these files, nothing would prevent them from adding other unlisted files. Similarly, if they could alter the site source code to render the list of links, they could make other malicious changes to normally innocuous files.

## Forensics

Using the Internet Archive, we looked at the page source for cached versions of the [YALI site](https://web.archive.org/web/*/yali.state.gov). By comparing source across several snapshots, it appears that the element listing "make money" links was introduced to the site on June 29-30th, 2021.

A similar approach was taken with the [YLAI snapshots](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ylai.state.gov), however, there are few versions cached and we were therefore unable to define a timeframe for introduction on YLAI. The most recent YLAI snapshot of June 19, 2021 did not include the list of links. It it therefore reasonable to assume that the change was introduced to YLAI around the same time as YALI.

Without further investigation it is impossible to determine how these changes were made to the site. Possible avenues include, but are not limited to:

1. A vulnerable plugin, theme, or version of WordPress
1. Accidental or intentional introduction by an internal actor

Looking at the file metadata for the _wikinews.php_ files on the server, the theme/plugin source control, and access logs may provide a more fulsome understanding of what happened.

## Conclusion

Given what we have seen, it appears that somebody has the ability to add unauthorized code/files to the following sites:

  - [Share America](share.america.gov)
  - [State Magazine](statemag.state.gov)
  - [YALI](yali.state.gov)
  - [YLAI](ylai.state.gov)
  
If true, this is a critical issue. The vector of attack should be identified and eliminated as soon as possible.
