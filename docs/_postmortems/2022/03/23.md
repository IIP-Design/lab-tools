## Incident Summary

On the afternoon of March 23, the Lab team was notified that two Domain Name System (DNS) records they manage were resolving to non-existent Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets. This posed a security vulnerability as a malicious actor could claim these buckets and serve arbitrary files from an apparently valid URL associated with the america.gov domain. Further investigation by the Lab team identified a third vulnerable URL.

This vulnerability was not exploited so there was no actual impact on any users or Department properties. Had the vulnerability been exploited, the following URLs could have been used to distribute malicious or reputationally harmful content:

- `staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net`
- `staticstatemag.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net`
- `statictranslations.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net`

While not truly subdomains of america.gov, their association with this Department-managed domain give these URLs the imprimatur of legitimacy. They could have been used to confuse or mislead individuals into accepting malicious content as official Department materials.

This vulnerability originated with a DNS record change on January 10, 2022. This change switched the proxy status of three america.gov subdomains (staticshare.america.gov, staticstatemag.america.gov, statictranslations.america.gov) to DNS-only mode. An unanticipated effect of this change was to point the three above URLs (ie. the subdomains with `.cdn.cloudflare.net` appended to the end) to non-existent S3 buckets.

Since the subdomains in question are no longer in use, the Lab team deleted the DNS records from Cloudflare. This had the effect of ending the redirect to S3 and thereby eliminating the vulnerability.

The domains in question were exposed to a potential bucket take over attack for about two months (January 10, 2022 - March 23, 2022). Once the Lab devops team was notified of the of the issue, the vulnerability was resolved within 90 minutes.

## Lead-Up

Up until 2020 the Lab team managed several WordPress sites at the behest of their GPA colleagues. These sites included:

- [ShareAmerica](https://share.america.gov)
- [State Magazine](https://statemag.state.gov)
- [Translations](https://translations.america.gov)

In order to improve the performance of these sites, the Lab team offloaded images and other static assets from these WordPress sites to AWS S3. This reduced the amount of storage and read/write ops on the WordPress server itself. It also allowed for asset caching through our CDN (Cloudflare) further optimizing for performance.

To accomplish this, an S3 bucket was created for each site. These buckets were configured for static hosting and stored all the static assets (ex. images) for each site. To avoid CORS errors, each of the buckets were assigned an america.gov subdomain via Cloudflare.

| site           | subdomain          | corresponding bucket                            |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ShareAmerica   | staticshare        | staticshare.america.gov.s3.amazonaws.com        |
| State Magazine | staticstatemag     | staticstatemag.america.gov.s3.amazonaws.com     |
| Translations   | statictranslations | statictranslations.america.gov.s3.amazonaws.com |

In October 2020 the Lab team transferred management of a number of WordPress sites (including the three listed above) over to GPA/DIG/WB (ie. the Web team). After this transfer, the Web team changed the way static assets are stored/managed on the sites. This obviated the need for the above static asset S3 buckets and their respective subdomains. However, the Lab team continued to maintain the static buckets and their accompanying subdomains in case residual traffic continued to come across to those URLs.

On January 10, 2022, during the course of a regular review of DNS records and page rules in Cloudflare, the Lab devops team changed the settings on the static asset subdomains. The changes consisted of switching the [proxy status](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) of the three static subdomains from `proxied` to `DNS-only`. The rationale behind this change was that since these subdomains were no longer in regular use, there was no need for the caching, analytics, and protection afforded by proxied traffic. This switch to DNS-only mode was seen as a step toward phasing out these subdomains. Any remaining traffic would continue to hit the appropriate bucket without using the CDN (with it's associated costs).

## Fault

By pointing an america.gov subdomain to an S3 bucket in Cloudflare, but not proxying traffic to this subdomain through Cloudflare, the Lab team inadvertently exposed three URLs to a bucket takeover attack.

These three URLs were not the actual america.gov subdomains. The DNS-only mode continued to redirect traffic to these subdomains correctly. In any case, those buckets still exist so are not and never were vulnerable to a bucket takeover attack.

The URLs that _were_ vulnerable were the subdomains followed by `.cdn.cloudflare.net`. These URLs where used in CNAME records on the parent america.gov domain, and instructed DNS servers to direct traffic to those subdomains to Cloudflare (which in turn directed traffic to S3).

In the future, the proxy status of subdomains pointing to an S3 bucket should always be proxied to avoid this subtle side effect.

## Impact

There was no actual adverse impact as a result of this incident. The error message received by users visiting the vulnerable URLs is _ipso facto_ evidence that the vulnerability was not being actively exploited.

A theoretical attack of the sort enabled by this vulnerability would take the form below:

1. A malicious actor could have created an Amazon S3 bucket called "staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net". Since S3 bucket names are globally unique and this bucket does not currently exist, anyone with an AWS account could have created this bucket.
1. The actor then uploads any files they like to the bucket. This could be asset files (like images or PDFs) or entire statically compiled websites.
1. With their S3 bucket now masquerading as a government property, the attacker convinces users to visit staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net in their browser to see the site or download the files that they are hosting in the S3 bucket.

Potential harms of such an attack include (in order of severity):

- **Defacement:** The attacker could post a hack notice in the S3 bucket and draw attention to their ability to infiltrate Department systems. This is often done to effect reputational harm or damage the target's brand.
- **Misinformation:** By posing as a government-sanctioned site or source of information, the attacker can distribute false or misleading information with the intent of undermining or mis-representing official US policies.
- **Distribution of Malicious Software:** - In the worst case scenario, the attacker uploads malicious files to the S3 bucket and then convinces users to download these files under the pretext that they are official Department content. This would expose the user's system and, potentially, Department networks to additional threat vectors.

Despite the above-mentioned risk factors of a bucket takeover, this attack vector for these particular URLS is somewhat limited for a couple reasons:

1. These subdomains were never in use except for the purposes of DNS resolution by Cloudflare. They were never referenced from any Department properties nor did the buckets they point to ever exist. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be any incidental traffic to these URLs and the attacker would have to somehow drive traffic to the URLs.
1. There is no direct connection between these URLs and other Department systems. This limits the attackers ability to leverage the bucket takeover for further attacks and reduces the probability of contagion.
1. The vulnerable URLs are long and rather clunky. Furthermore, while they include the words "america.gov" they are not truly subdomains of america.gov. It is likely that many users would be put off by the unusual URLs and might become suspicious of the content.

This is not to negate the validity of the vulnerability, which in this case the Lab team would consider of mild-to-moderate severity.

## Detection

The problem was discovered on March 17 by the Cybersecurity Integrity Center (CIC), presumably in the course of a routine automated scan. On March 21, CIC sent the following report to GPA/EX/IT for resolution:

> On March 17, 2022, using log analysis, the Blue Team (BT) has identified multiple unclaimed S3 buckets in AWS associated with America.gov. This vulnerability occurs when an S3 bucket is deleted but a CNAME DNS record pointing to the bucket is left in place. Attackers can create S3 buckets with the same name, allowing them to host malicious files on the victimâ€™s domain. While the BT has not identified evidence of active compromise, these DNS records place America.gov at continued risk of this kind of subdomain takeover.

The report then found it's way to the Lab team relatively quickly (2 days). It is possible that closer coordination between Lab, GPA/EX/IT, and GPA/DIG/WB may have shaved this down to one day or even few hours.

Time to detection may also have been reduced if by one of the following:

- More thorough manual testing of subdomains following DNS changes. Although, in this case, the vulnerable domains were never actually in use. Therefore, manual testing would be unlikely to find the misconfiguration.
- Automated scanning of a more limited subset of subdomains managed by the Lab team. This more targeted analysis could potentially be run after any DNS change and might find such issues. That said, it should be noted that the Lab team currently has no such scanning capability and would have to invest resources if they were to identify and implement such a solution.

## Response

Once notified of the issue, the Lab team's response was swift and decisive. The initial CIC report, while wrong on some of the particulars, was broadly correct in identifying the source of the issue and pointing the Lab team towards successful resolution.

The Lab devops team inspected the URLs provided in the CIC report both in the browser and using the `dig` DNS query tool. They confirmed that they were indeed redirecting to an unclaimed S3 bucket. The team expanded it's investigation beyond the two listed URLs to all subdomains associated with S3 buckets. In the course of this investigation, the team identified a third vulnerable URL - "staticstatemag.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net".

Next the team identified recent changes to the proxy settings for three subdomains (staticshare, staticstatemag, and statictranslations) on america.gov as the core problem. The team's first inclination was to simply re-enable proxying on the subdomains, thereby returning to the _status quo ante_. However, after further consideration the team decided to remove the DNS records entirely.

The Lab team encountered no obstacles while taking this course of action.

## Recovery

There was no downtime or data loss so recovery was not required.

## Timeline

All times are EDT.

**January 10, 2022**

11:26 - The Lab team, in the course of disabling old DNS records, changes the proxy status on three subdomains that pointed to S3 buckets. This had the inadvertent result of directing traffic to non-existent buckets.

**March 17, 2022:**

The Cybersecurity Integrity Center's (CIC) Blue Team identifies that two URLs associated with america.gov DNS records are pointing to non-existent buckets.

**March 21, 2022:**

10:36 - CIC sends a report on the issue and their remediation recommendations to GPA/EX/IT for routing to the appropriate GPA team.

**March 22, 2022**

9:04 - GPA/EX/IT, believing that the DNS records in question were under the control of the Web team (GPA/DIG/WB), forwards the report to the Web team.

**March 23, 2022:**

10:34 - GPA/DIG/WB identifies Lab as the team responsible for the domain records and forwards the CIC report to the Lab's Acting Director.

14:01 - The Lab's Acting Director in turn forwards the report to the dev team

14:21 - The Lab devops team begins to investigate the issue

14:56 - The Lab devops team determines that it is safe to remove the offending DNS records. The CNAME records for the `staticshare`, `statictranslations`, and `staticstatemag` are deleted.

15:28 - The Lab devops team reports back to the Lab Acting Director that the vulnerability has been addressed. At this point the incident is considered resolved.

## Root Cause Identification

The CIC Blue Team, while scanning subdomains of america.gov encountered the following error message for a number of DNS records that were previously proxied through Cloudflare:

```xml
<Error>
  <Code>NoSuchBucket</Code>
  <Message>The specified bucket does not exist.</Message>
  <BucketName>staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net</BucketName>
  <RequestId>XXXXX</RequestId>
  <HostId>XXXXX</HostId>
</Error>
```

As this error indicates, the URLs in question were pointing to an AWS S3 bucket that does not exist. This behavior derived from the mapping of several america.gov subdomains to S3 buckets for the purposes of serving static content. This mapping can be visualize as so:

![A flowchart wherein 1) the parent domain's DNS management delegates a subdomain to 2) Cloudflare which in turn points to 3) an AWS S3 bucket.]({{ '/assets/2022/03/dns-diagram.svg' | relative_url }})

Particularizing this general model to the case of ShareAmerica's static assets, the flow of DNS records in the regular, proxied configuration can be modelled thusly:

![A flowchart wherein 1) the america.gov domain records contain 2) a CNAME record for the staticshare subdomain which points to 3) the Cloudflare CDN using the URL staticshare.america.goc.cdn.cloudflare.net which in turn points to 4) the AWS S3 bucket at staticshare.america.gov.s3.amazonaws.com]({{ '/assets/2022/03/sharestatic-diagram.svg' | relative_url }})

In an effort to save resources (by reducing Cloudflare service usage) while preserving the availability of these legacy assets, the proxy status of these subdomains was changed to DNS-only mode. After the change, the DNS flow took the following form:

![A flowchart wherein 1) the america.gov domain records contain 2) a CNAME record for staticshare subdomain which points to 3) the Cloudflare CDN using the URL staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net which in turn points to 4) the AWS S3 Bucket at staticshare.america.gov.s3.amazonaws.com and  creates a new route to 5) the AWS non-existent S3 Bucket at staticshare.america.gov.cdn.cloudflare.net.s3.amazonaws.com]({{ '/assets/2022/03/sharestatic-dns-only-diagram.svg' | relative_url }})

In retrospect it is now clear that setting a subdomain to point to S3 in DNS-only mode is a misconfiguration. It had the unanticipated side effect of directing any traffic if a subdomain of Cloudflare's CDN to an unclaimed S3 bucket opening the possibility of a bucket takeover attack.

## Root Cause

The simultaneous urges to maintain support for legacy URLs while reducing the overhead of our CDN lead to a DNS misconfiguration, which in turned opened up the security vulnerability.

## Backlog Check

While there are no tasks in the backlog pertaining to DNS records, the Lab team's systems engineer has in the past advocated for cleaning up the DNS records and page rules in Cloudflare. The wide variety of projects supported by the Lab and a desire to maintain backwards compatibility to the greatest extent possible has resulted in .

The Lab team should periodically review all DNS records deleting those that are no longer needed. Such regular housekeeping should help to avoid similar subtle bugs in the future.

## Recurrence

There have been no other known incidents resulting from this DNS configuration or other similar misconfigurations.

All remaining subdomains that are configured to point to S3 bucket proxy traffic through Cloudflare avoiding the errors of the three impacted subdomains.

## Corrective Actions

Immediate corrective action was taken to remove three CNAME records in Cloudflare. These records were originally created to point the following subdomains to corresponding AWS S3 buckets:

- staticshare
- staticstatemag
- statictranslations

The subdomains are no longer in use so deleting the associated records was a safe and appropriate course of action.

Additionally, the devops team identified several other old DNS records that were safe to remove. Namely:

| type  | name                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| CNAME | publications.america.gov     |
| A     | www.publications.america.gov |
| CNAME | interactive.america.gov      |
| A     | www.interactive.america.gov  |
| CNAME | share.america.gov            |
| CNAME | statemag.state.gov           |
| A     | www.statemag.state.gov       |
| CNAME | translations.state.gov       |

These records have been superceded by changes to the parent domain records and hence were no longer reachable. While they posed no risk themselves, cleaning up the DNS record helps to manage the Cloudflare account more easily thereby potentially helping to avoid future confusion.

There might be some follow up needed with the Department DNS team to remove the subdomain CNAME records on the parent domain (america.gov). Again, the presence of these records poses no risk, but removing unused records is good practice.

Internal Lab devops documentation will be updated to ensure that subdomains routed to S3 buckets are always proxied, avoiding recurrence of this issue. Additionally, the team resolves to periodically review DNS records . A cadence for this review has not been determined yet, but perhaps quarterly reviews would be appropriate.
